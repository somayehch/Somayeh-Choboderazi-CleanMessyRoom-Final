### 🖼️ example_predictions_2.png — Example Predictions (Set 2)

This is a second set of prediction examples.  
Different images help show whether the model can handle variety, such as:

- Different types of rooms  
- Different lighting  
- Different angles  
- Different levels of messiness  

Showing multiple sets of predictions proves the model can generalize and is not just memorizing the training data.
