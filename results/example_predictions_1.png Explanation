### 🖼️ example_predictions_1.png — Example Predictions (Set 1)

This picture shows how the model predicts Clean and Messy rooms on real test images.  
Each image includes the prediction and whether it was correct.

This helps me see:

- If the model understands visual features of a clean or messy room  
- How the model behaves on new images it has not seen before  
- Whether the model is learning meaningful patterns such as clutter, floor visibility, and organization  

Seeing prediction examples makes the model’s performance easier to understand visually.
