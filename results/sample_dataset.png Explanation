### 🖼️ sample_dataset.png — Preview of the Dataset

This picture shows a small sample of the images used in my Clean vs. Messy Room classification project.  
It helps confirm that the dataset is working correctly before training the model.

By looking at this preview, I can make sure that:

- The images load correctly  
- Both categories (Clean and Messy rooms) are included  
- The pictures are clear and realistic  
- There is variety in lighting, angle, and room layout  

This step is important because the quality of the dataset affects how well the model learns.
