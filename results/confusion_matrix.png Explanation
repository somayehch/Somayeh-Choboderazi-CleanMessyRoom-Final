### 📉 confusion_matrix.png — Model Performance Summary

This picture shows the confusion matrix, which is a key tool for understanding how well the model performs.

The confusion matrix explains:

- How many Clean rooms were correctly identified  
- How many Messy rooms were correctly identified  
- Where the model made mistakes  
- Whether the model confuses one category with the other  

Correct predictions appear on the diagonal, while mistakes appear off the diagonal.  
This picture gives a deeper and more complete understanding of the model’s accuracy beyond a simple number.
