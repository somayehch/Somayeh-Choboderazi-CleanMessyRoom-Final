## 📘 Project Summary

This project focuses on building a deep learning model that classifies room images as Clean or Messy.  
The model was trained using a custom dataset and fine-tuned with a ResNet50 architecture.

The work demonstrates:

- Custom dataset creation and preparation  
- Deep learning model training  
- Model evaluation and visualization  
- A simple user interface for testing images  
- Proper folder structure for an AI project
