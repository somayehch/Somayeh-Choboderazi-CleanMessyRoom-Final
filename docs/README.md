# Project Documentation – Clean vs Messy Room Classifier

This folder contains additional documentation and summaries related to the Clean vs Messy Room Classification Final Project for ITAI-1378 (Computer Vision).

These documents provide project insights, development notes, and extended explanations beyond the main README.

## 📘 Project Summary

This project focuses on building a deep learning model that can classify images of rooms as **Clean** or **Messy**.  
Using a custom dataset and transfer learning with **ResNet50**, the model was trained to recognize patterns associated with clutter, tidiness, and overall room organization.

The project demonstrates:

- Dataset creation and preprocessing  
- Deep learning model training (PyTorch)  
- Evaluation and visualization of results  
- A simple user interface for testing real images  
- Proper folder structure for an AI portfolio project

## 🧠 Key Contributions

- **Custom Dataset Creation:** Gathered real home images using Bing Image Downloader.  
- **Model Training:** Fine-tuned ResNet50 for binary classification.  
- **Performance:** Achieved strong validation accuracy with a small but well-curated dataset.  
- **Evaluation:** Saved sample results and predictions in the `results/` folder.  
- **Demo Notebook:** Built an interactive interface for users to upload an image and receive a prediction.
