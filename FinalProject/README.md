# Clean vs. Messy Room Classification – Final Project

## 📝 Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify room images as **Clean** or **Messy**.  
It demonstrates essential Computer Vision steps including preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization.

This final project contains **four Jupyter Notebooks**, each handling a separate stage of the workflow.
